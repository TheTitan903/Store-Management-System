This is a Store Management System with Python front end and MySQL backend.
I used mysql.connector to make a connection. 
I have two tables admin and items in MySQL.
The admin table has details of the admin and I have implemented an OTP mechanism for logging in of admins. 
The items table has details of all the existing items in the shop and the customer can buy items.
The pdf file in the repository has proper documentation including output screenshots.
